    unique_array([ {a=>1}, {b=>2}, {c=>3}, {b=>2} ])
    # yields

    merge_hash(
        { a => 1, b => [{ b => 2 }, { c => 3 }] },
        { a => 2, b => [{ b => 2 }, { d => 4 }] },
    );
    # yields
    { a => 2, b => [{ b => 2}, { c => 3 }, { d => 4 }] },
    
    merge_hash(
        { a => 1, b => [{ b => 2 }, { c => 3 }] },
        { a => 2, b => [{ b => 2 }, { d => 4 }] },
        'LEFT_PRECEDENT'
